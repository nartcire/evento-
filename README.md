## Motivation

This is the first ever NextJS project that I've created, and I was really excited to explore the various features and tools that NextJS provides. Within this project, I've learned about the client vs server side rendering as well as how to properly structure the files for NextJS. Using NextJS will allow me to more easily create web apps that require multiple pages and easily integrate caching as well improved performance for a better user experience. Additionally, the site is hosted on Vercel and uses Postgress as the databse. This is also my first time using Vercel! Used tailwindcss as well as it is required to use NextJS.

## Description

- allow users to search for events happening in their city of interest
- allow users to look at a list of all events coming up
- allow users to fetch from a postgress database hosted on vercel
- used prism to help interact with our database
- used Zod to help force checks on user inputted page parameters in the url
- added in simple middleware to redirect users from /events to /events/all
- added in loading pages with skeleton compoments
- used framer motion to help with smooth transtions when switching from the "home" nav to the "all events" nav
- used fromer motion to implement the size increase of the individual event listing as the user scrolls
- used tailwind css to structure and form the look of the web app
- used opengraph-image to give our website's urls a preview image
- used vercel to host the node.js website
- used postgress as our database
- used prism to help interact with our database
